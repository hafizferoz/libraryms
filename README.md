Library Management System in Java and Spring Boot Application.

Status Tracking: Users can view their borrowed books and waiting list positions.

Fresh Start: Each session execution creates a new environment. The system uses in memory H2 db which will refresh on restart. 


# Implementation Details:

Tech Stack: Java, Springboot and H2 DB (in memory)

Waiting list Logic:
When a book is returned, the first person in the waiting list automatically gets it and 
Waiting list positions are dynamically updated. While changes are pushed in DB as batch, however for real world scenarios cacheing mechanism can be utilized for better performance.
Users are notified on login if they received a book from their waiting list. The status is 

Command Parsing: Booth quoted and unquoted book names are handled.
